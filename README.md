# Emotion Classification from Text

This repository contains the implementation of machine learning models to classify emotions from text samples using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The project focuses on using models like Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict emotions such as **anger**, **joy**, **fear**, and others based on textual input.


## Overview
Emotion classification is an important task in sentiment analysis and natural language processing, as it helps in understanding the sentiment expressed in user-generated content like reviews, social media posts, etc. This project preprocesses text data, extracts meaningful features using TF-IDF, and trains machine learning models to classify the emotions expressed in the text.

The models used:
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

## Dataset
The dataset contains textual samples labeled with their corresponding emotions. It includes sentences or comments that are tagged with one of several emotions (e.g., joy, anger, fear, etc.).

- Input: Text (comments, sentences).
- Output: Emotion labels (e.g., anger, fear, joy).
